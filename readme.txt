I put classes which work whith JSON file into new package "\dataWorker\workingWithJSONFiles".
Cause` i decide, our datafile (.json and .sql) must be in one directory;

Sorry about this

If you want to get cart (List<Devises> cart in CustomerBasket) you can use getter for this variable, becouse it must be private.
