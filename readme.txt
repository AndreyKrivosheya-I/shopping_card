Look, I fix my sql query and database work without problems

Also, I fix CastomerBascet. Now you can use it in updating json`s file

Please, for read and write data in json`s file (cart and storage) use special methods: fillDataFromJSON() and updateStorageAndCartJSON() from ChooseDevices class

Than, try to don`t write code in Main class. I want, all our progrom work without Main class, just this class musl call special method (choose() from ChooseDevices class)

And last, now our json`s and sql`s files are dissynchronized (that is concain different data). I hope, we will fix in the future

I wish you good mood and clear mindset. If you have some problems with undestending my "beatiful" code, just call me and I try to help
I Love U)
